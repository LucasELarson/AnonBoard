# AnonBoard is a simple anonymous messaging board built with React and Firebase.

There are several topics in a slider just under the header that you can click on to go to another topic. Each topic has comments showing most recent to least recent.

The number underneath the "Topic Tiles" shows how many comments have been made in that thread. When you make a new comment that number will update for everyone.

There are no credentials or locally stored information so it is anonymous.
